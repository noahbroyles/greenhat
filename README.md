greenhat is a quick hack for decorating your GitHub contribution calendar with commits for the past `n` days. It uses the `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` environmental variables to make commits appear in the past. Be warned that greenhat will clobber your repository's commit history.

**Bro, wait what?!?!** I've always wondered how those people have like, more contributions than *me*. I **knew** there was cheating going on somewhere.

I would **totally** use this, but I have a moral stance against cheating to look better on GitHub. Still the idea behind this program was beautiful. ðŸ˜‰
